# Token Model

The EtherCore token (ERE) is a universal currency based on the EtherCore Protocol, distributed to incentivize different participants in the ecosystem of the EtherCore mainnet. Unlike any other different tokens, it will be issued on the dedicated mainnet developed by the team without any form of tokens distributed on the different mainnets like ERC20 on Ethereum or etc.

A total supply of 1,000,000,000 (One billion) ERE tokens will be issued during mining period and the premine for airdrop, ecosystem distribution, development and marketing funds.

+	5% of the total supply will be issued from premine pool and will be used for IEO (Initial Exchange Offering) sale to invite more participants to the ecosystem
+	10% of the total supply will be issued from premine pool and will be distributed as an airdrop to Ethereum stake holders for promotion.
+	30% of the total supply will be issued from the premine pool and will be allocated for the ecosystem formation which will be locked into the smart contract for 2 years from the genesis block.
+	5% of the total supply will be issued from the premine pool and will be allocated for the development team for marketing purpose
+	50% of the total supply will be allocated for public mining, miners who mine the blocks will receive the mining reward for the long term

Mining rewards will be cut in half after the specific period of time, to ensure long term mining for EtherCore mainnet. Unlike Ethereum, there will be a maximum cap of 1,000,000,000 ( One billion ) tokens for issuance.
