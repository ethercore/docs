# Glossary

## A

### API

* application programming interface.

### ASIC

* application-specific integrated circuit. A microchip designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining.

## B

### BFT

* Byzantine Fault tolerance, a property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of \(or one or more faults within\) some of its components

## D

### DApp

* Decentralized applications, a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system.

## G

### GPU

* graphics processing unit. a special stream processor used in computer graphics hardware.

## H

### Hashing

* using a mathematical function to derive a fixed length numeric or alphanumeric string from a piece of data of any length.

### Hashrate

* a hashrate is the speed at which a computer can solve a hashing problem. The probability of a miner successfully mining a block before anyone else is partially determined by the hashrate of their mining operations.

## P

### PoA

* Proof-of-Authority, a consensus mechanism that is similar to Proof-of-Work, but doesn't requires additional work information from nodes.

### PoW

* Proof-of-Work, a consensus mechanism that is used to deters denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network.

### ProgPoW

* ProgPoW represents an ASIC resistant, GPU friendly programmatic Proof-of-Work mining consensus algorithm.

## S

### Smart Contract

* a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.
